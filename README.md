D-TILE: Design-Thinking, Innovation and Leadership for Engineers

## 1. Innovation Process: Overview

-   **Why Use an Innovation Process?**
    -   To easily remember important steps
    -   To have a shared language with your team
    -   Process produces consistently good outcomes
    -   Prevents "Inventor's Block"
-   This process works for products, services, processes, policy, and everything else.

    -   **Technology** (Feasibility)
    -   **Business** (Viability)
    -   **People** (Desirability)
-   The D-TILE (Blade Kotelly Inc.) model adds a fourth component:
    -   **Culture** (Relevancy)

---

## 2. Discover & Define

### 2.1. Needs & Assumptions Analysis

-   **Purpose**:
    -   Understand the needs we want to satisfy.
    -   Identify areas that we assume can't be challenged or haven't been challenged.
    -   Use this information to explore opportunities for innovation.

#### Needs Analysis

-   What are the needs of the **customer/user**?
-   What are the needs of our **company/team**?

#### Innovation Assumptions

-   An Innovation Assumption is something we may have not considered improving or changing, or which hasn’t changed in a long time.
-   These assumptions provide opportunities for exploration.

---

### 2.2. Research & Discovery

#### Common Research Methods

-   Ethnographic (participant observation)
-   Surveys/interviews/feedback analysis
-   Expert analysis
-   Architecture analysis
-   Patent/literature review
-   Meta-analysis
-   Eye tracking/electroencephalography (EEG)

#### Morphological Analysis

-   Learn about your problem space by comparing similar solutions and dissimilar solutions (analogs).
-   Choose relevant **objective** and **subjective** criteria.
-   Look for patterns and draw interesting conclusions from the analysis.

**Morphological Analysis Template**

| Competitors   | Feature 1             | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | F... |
| :------------ | :-------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :--- |
| _[Product 1]_ | _[Explain feature 1]_ |           |           |      |
| _[Product 2]_ | _[Explain feature 2]_ |           |           |      |
| _[Product 3]_ | _[Explain feature 3]_ |           |           |      |

---

### 2.3. Stakeholder Analysis

#### Definition & Reason

-   **Definition**: A stakeholder is a person or group that has an investment, share, or interest in something.
-   **Why Analyze**:
    -   Establishes a global perspective (Systems Thinking).
    -   Helps make good decisions, tradeoffs, and establish priorities.
    -   Not all stakeholders benefit positively.

#### 4 Groups

1.  **Suppliers**: Provide resources needed to create & deliver the solution.
2.  **Users / Directly Affected**: Use the solution or are directly affected by it.
3.  **Transformers**: Involved in the creation, delivery, or execution of the solution.
4.  **Approvers / Blockers & Concerned**: Can prevent creation/delivery, or may be concerned about indirect effects.

#### Ranking Stakeholders

**Stakeholder Ranking Template**

| Stakeholder          | Why We Care About Them                 | Not Prioritized | Low | Med | High | What They Care About/How To Satisfy      |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :-------------: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :--------------------------------------- |
| _[List stakeholder]_ | _[Value they provide or need from us]_ |                 |     |     |      | _[Their primary goals, concerns, needs]_ |

---

### 2.4. Boundary & Hazard Mitigation

#### Identification & Mitigation

-   **Identification**:
    -   Identify what you are (or might be) limited by (**boundaries**).
    -   Identify what could go wrong (**hazards**).
-   **Mitigation**:
    -   Identify boundary mitigation strategies.
    -   Identify hazard mitigation strategies.

#### Ranking Boundaries & Hazard

-   Assign **Likelihood** (chance it happens) and **Severity** (how bad it is if it happens) ratings.
-   Calculate **Expected Impact** by multiplying Likelihood x Severity.
-   Determine mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness.

**Boundary/Hazard Ranking Template**

| Boundary/Hazard          | Likelihood (0-10) | Severity (0-10) | Expected Impact (= Likelihood x Severity) | Mitigation Strategy          | Cost-Effectiveness |
| :----------------------- | :---------------: | :-------------: | :---------------------------------------: | :--------------------------- | :----------------: |
| _[List boundary/hazard]_ |                   |                 |                                           | _[How to prevent/reduce it]_ |  _[High/Med/Low]_  |

#### Considerations

-   When identifying boundaries and hazards, consider:
    -   Resources
    -   Operation/Use
    -   Creation, Delivery, Execution
    -   Externalities

---

### 2.5. Specify Desired Outcomes

-   Desired outcomes define **what** must happen, not **how** it is reached.

#### Methods in Corporations

-   MRD (Market Requirements Document)
-   PRD (Product Requirements Document)
-   Manufacturing specification

#### Desired Outcomes for Innovations

1.  **Intellectual objectives**: Appeals to the rational mind (e.g., "make the hospital more money").
2.  **Emotional objectives**: Appeals to feelings (e.g., "make patients happier").
3.  **Success criteria & goals**: Objective and subjective measurements (e.g., "90% of operators complete the task in < 3 mins").

**Desired Outcomes Template**

| Objective          | Objective Type               | How Will You Measure Success?                  |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| _[State the goal]_ | _[Intellectual / Emotional]_ | _[List objective/subjective success criteria]_ |

#### Conditions

-   Outcomes should be aggressive and attainable, clear and inspiring.
-   Too specific is just as bad as too vague.

---

## 3. Explore & Explain

### 3.1. Concept Generation

#### Techniques

-   Open Brainstorming: Silent generation, sharing, grouping, then verbal generation.
-   Mind Mapping
-   Forced Relationships: Combine unrelated items to spark new ideas.
-   “To”-“By”-“Using”

---

### 3.2. Concept Downselection

-   Examine all ideas and eliminate as many as possible (for now).
-   Score concepts against weighted criteria.
-   Possible Criteria: Satisfy core user needs, low brand risk, competitive advantage, strong ROI, low resource requirements, technical feasibility.

**Concept Downselection Template**

|                |            | **Concept 1 (1-5)** |              | **Concept 2 (1-5)** |              |
| :------------- | :--------: | :-----------------: | :----------: | :-----------------: | :----------: |
| **Criteria**   | **Weight** |      **Score**      | **Weighted** |      **Score**      | **Weighted** |
| _[Criteria 1]_ |            |                     |              |                     |              |
| _[Criteria 2]_ |            |                     |              |                     |              |
| _[Criteria 3]_ |            |                     |              |                     |              |
| **Totals**     |            |                     | **[Total]**  |                     | **[Total]**  |

---

**K-Script Template**

| Who             | Observable Action                       | Unobservable Action / Notes                                          |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _[Stakeholder]_ | _[What the person does, says, or sees]_ | _[Internal thoughts, assumptions, team questions, design rationale]_ |

---

## 4. Make & Measure

This phase is about accelerating learning to reduce uncertainty.

-   **Concept**: Solution elements (features) are plotted on a 2D graph of **Importance** (y-axis) vs. **Uncertainty** (x-axis).
-   **Risk**: The risk of an element is its **Importance x Uncertainty**.
-   **Threshold**: A **Risk Tolerance Threshold** is set. Any element with a risk score above this threshold is a high priority.
-   **Goal**: Run fast, inexpensive experiments (prototypes) to reduce the "Uncertainty" score for high-risk elements, moving them down below the threshold.

---

### 4.1. Uncertainty Identification

-   **Risk: Importance & Uncertainty**
    1.  For each element of the solution, determine its **Importance** and its **Uncertainty**.
    2.  Multiply Importance by Uncertainty to determine the risk.
    3.  Determine which elements are above the risk tolerance threshold.

**Uncertainty Identification Template**

| Element Of Possible Uncertainty              | Importance (1-10) | Uncertainty (1-10) | Uncertainty x Importance (Risk) |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| _[e.g., ML tech can provide nutrition info]_ |   _[e.g., 10]_    |    _[e.g., 8]_     |          _[e.g., 80]_           |
| _[e.g., People will take pictures of food]_  |    _[e.g., 8]_    |    _[e.g., 6]_     |          _[e.g., 48]_           |
| _[e.g., We can make an easy-to-use app]_     |    _[e.g., 8]_    |    _[e.g., 2]_     |          _[e.g., 16]_           |

---

### 4.2. Uncertainty Reduction

#### Affordability

-   For each uncertain element, determine the **least expensive way** to reduce uncertainty.
-   Increase time, effort, and cost only when necessary.

#### Prototype

-   Prototypes are versions of a whole solution or parts of it.
-   **Physical** (Looks-like)
-   **Operational** (Works-like)
-   **Experiential** (Feels-like)

**Uncertainty Reduction Plan Template**

| Feature                 | Uncertainty x Importance (Risk) | Inexpensive Methods to Reduce Uncertainty                                           |
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _[High-risk feature 1]_ |          _[e.g., 80]_           | _[e.g., Ask a machine learning expert]_                                             |
| _[High-risk feature 2]_ |          _[e.g., 48]_           | _[e.g., Ask 5 people to take pictures of their food for 3 days and interview them]_ |

#### Usability Testing

-   **Explanation**: A method to reduce uncertainty by having real users interact with a product to identify issues and areas for improvement.
-   The primary goal is to identify problems, collect qualitative/quantitative data, and determine participant satisfaction.
-   We want to learn:
    -   Can people use it?
    -   Do they enjoy using it?
    -   Does the user form a correct **mental model** of the system?

**Usability Report Format Template**

| Issue # | Description                                    | UX Severity (1-5)  | Complexity to Fix (1-5) | Resolution                                  |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------: | :---------------------: | :------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | _[e.g., User didn't see the 'next' button...]_ | _[e.g., 4 (high)]_ |    _[e.g., 1 (low)]_    | _[e.g., consider changing button color...]_ |
| 2       |                                                |                    |                         |                                             |

#### Mental Model

-   A mental model is an explanation of someone's thought process about how something works in the real world.
-   It enables a person to extend knowledge from one area to another.

---

## 5. Problem Definition

-   This is Step 1 of the process, revisited. "A problem well stated is a problem half-solved".

### 5.1. A Well-Defined Problem

-   Makes it easy for you to understand how to solve the problem.
-   Makes it easy for others to understand the problem and the value of solving it.
-   Motivates people to help you create value.

---

### 5.2. Kotelly Problem Definition Structure

This structure focuses the reader on the outcome, not a specific solution.

-   **[Affected group, "who?"]** currently **[way they currently address the situation]**.
-   The reason we need to make a change is because **[motivating reason why the status quo is a problem, including consequences]**.
-   Therefore, we will create a solution that enables **[affected group]** to **[experience a desired outcome]**.

---

### 5.3. 6 Common Mistakes

**Mistakes with Logic:**

1.  **Incorrectly identified affected group**: Stating a group that's part of the system but not the end-user.
2.  **Not stating the root problem**: Stating a downstream problem instead of the core issue.
3.  **Specifying the solution**: The outcome is too narrow and only allows one way to solve the problem.

**Mistakes with Articulation:** 

4. Not-stating the current approach/method **neutrally**. 
5. Not creating **clarity** about why the problem should be addressed. 
6. Not stating the **magnitude and impact** of not solving the problem.

---

## 6. Launch, Iterate, or Stop

-   This is the 12th and final step, where a decision is made based on the "Make & Measure" phase.

### 6.1. Launch

-   Assemble key information for execution teams.
-   **Must-haves**: Clear problem statement and a compelling vision of the solution.
-   **Supporting info**: Stakeholder analysis, risk/hazard analysis, concept articulation, prototype results, and desired outcomes.

---

### 6.2. Iterate

-   Catalog all information (problem statement, research, concepts, etc.).
-   Create an **SWQ analysis**:
    -   What learnings were **S**uccessful?
    -   What were the **W**eaknesses of the concepts?
    -   What **Q**uestions should we answer in the next iteration?

---

### 6.3. Stop

-   Catalog all information (same as Iterate).
-   Create an **SW analysis**:
    -   What learning was **S**uccessful?
    -   What were the **W**eaknesses of the concepts?
-   Develop a **new problem statement** to explore other valuable areas.

---

## 7. Appendix

### Summary: "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning" (Rittel & Webber)

This paper argues that social policy problems are **"wicked" problems**, which are inherently different from the **"tame" problems** of science and engineering.

-   **Tame Problems**: Can be definitively described. They have clear missions and it's clear when a solution is found (e.g., solving a math equation).
-   **Wicked Problems**: Cannot be definitively described. They are ill-defined, and social problems are never truly "solved," only "re-solved over and over again". Examples include locating a freeway or confronting crime.

**Ten Properties of Wicked Problems:**

1.  **No definitive formulation**. The process of formulating the problem is the same as conceiving the solution. You can't understand the problem without having an idea of its solution.
2.  **No stopping rule**. There is no logical end to the problem. Planners stop for external reasons (e.g., out of time, money, or patience), not because the solution is perfect.
3.  **Solutions are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad**. There is no objective way to determine correctness. Assessments are "good enough" or "better or worse" based on different value-sets and interests.
4.  **No immediate and no ultimate test**. Any solution generates waves of consequences over an unbounded time, and these repercussions cannot be fully appraised.
5.  **Every solution is a "one-shot operation"**. There is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error without significant consequences. An implemented solution (like a freeway) is effectively irreversible and leaves "traces".
6.  **No enumerable set of potential solutions**. There is no exhaustive list of all possible solutions or permissible moves.
7.  **Every wicked problem is essentially unique**. Despite similarities to past problems, there may always be a unique, overriding property. Transferring a solution from one context to another is harmful.
8.  **Every wicked problem can be a symptom of another problem**. The level at which a problem is formulated (e.g., "crime in the streets" as a symptom of poverty) determines its resolution.
9.  **The choice of explanation determines the resolution**. A discrepancy can be explained in numerous ways, and there is no "correct" one. The analyst's "world view" is the strongest factor in resolving the problem.
10. **The planner has no right to be wrong**. Unlike a scientist, a planner is liable for the consequences of their actions, which have real effects on people's lives.

**Social Context:**

-   Society is not homogeneous but increasingly **pluralistic** and heterogeneous.
-   In a pluralistic society, there is no "undisputable public good" and no objective definition of equity.
-   What is a "problem-solution" for one group is "problem-generation" for another.
-   Planning is a component of politics, and the expert is a player in a political game.

### Summary: "Design of Everyday Things" (Ch. 6 Design Thinking)

This chapter defines design thinking as a process focused on first finding the **right problem** and then finding the **right solution**.

-   **Solving the Correct Problem**:

    -   The problem you are given is invariably a **symptom**, not the real, fundamental, root problem.
    -   Engineers and businesspeople are trained to _solve_ problems; designers are trained to _discover_ the real problems.
    -   A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all.

-   **The Double-Diamond Model of Design**:

    -   This model shows how designers first **diverge** to explore options, then **converge** on a decision. This is done twice.
    -   **Phase 1: Finding the Right Problem**
        -   **Divergence (Discover):** Expand thinking to explore all underlying issues.
        -   **Convergence (Define):** Settle on the real, underlying problem to be solved.
    -   **Phase 2: Finding the Right Solution**
        -   **Divergence (Develop):** Explore a wide variety of potential solutions.
        -   **Convergence (Deliver):** Converge on a single proposed solution.

-   **The Human-Centered Design (HCD) Process**:
    -   HCD is the **iterative** method used _within_ the double-diamond model.
    -   It consists of a repeating cycle of four activities: **Observation, Idea Generation, Prototyping, and Testing**.

**The Four HCD Activities:**

1.  **Observation (Design Research)**:
    -   Understand the nature of the problem by observing people in their natural environment.
    -   This is often done using **applied ethnography**.
    -   **Design Research** (qualitative, deep insights from a few people) seeks to understand _real needs_.
    -   **Market Research** (quantitative, broad data from many people) seeks to understand _what people will buy_. Both are necessary.
2.  **Idea Generation (Ideation)**:
    -   The creative phase.
    -   **Key Rules**:
        -   Generate _numerous_ ideas.
        -   Be creative _without regard for constraints_; do not criticize or dismiss ideas prematurely.
        -   **Question everything**, especially "stupid questions" about things everyone assumes are obvious.
3.  **Prototyping**:
    -   The only way to know if an idea is reasonable is to test it.
    -   Mock-ups can be simple sketches, cardboard models, or even skits.
    -   The **"Wizard of Oz"** technique involves faking a system's functionality (e.g., a human types responses for a supposed AI) to test requirements early.
4.  **Testing**:
    -   Gather a small group (e.g., **five people**) from the target population.
    -   Have them use the prototype in a realistic context.
    -   Testing five people is usually enough to find the major problems. It is better to test and iterate multiple times (e.g., test 5, fix, test 5 more) than to test a large group once.

-   **Iteration**:
    -   The HCD process is repeated to enable continual refinement.
    -   The goal is to **"Fail frequently, fail fast"**.
    -   "Failures" are valuable **learning experiences**.
    -   Getting requirements right is the hardest part of design and requires iteration. Asking people what they need is "invariably wrong"; observing them is better.

### Summary: "Radical Innovation Through Design Thinking" (Blade Kotelly)

This article positions design thinking as a key discipline for achieving radical innovation, especially when organizations are pressured to do more with less.

-   **What is Design Thinking?**

    -   It is a **process, mindset, and set of techniques** that can be learned by anyone to be more creative, analyze situations, and rapidly create solutions.
    -   It helps technical people innovate within real business constraints by enforcing a holistic view and the value of understanding all stakeholders.
    -   It teaches how to test new concepts quickly to understand their value.

-   **Three Essential Factors:**

    1.  **User-Centered Mindset**: Everything we make is for a user. You must see the world from their perspective, feel their frustrations as your own, and work to eliminate them. The goal is to delight the user.
    2.  **Applicable to Any Problem**: It's a process that ensures you don't skip steps. It involves thinking through potential user problems _before_ designing, so you can prevent them.
    3.  **Challenge the Problem**: This is the most important step. Don't take a problem at face value; challenge the assumptions "baked into" it. Ask "Why is it a problem?" to find more impactful solutions.

-   **How to Start:**

    -   Begin with small problems or by refining existing processes.
    -   Expect and encourage small **failures**. A "failure" where you learn something valuable is not catastrophic and helps you refine your skills.

-   **Innovation and Leadership:**
    -   Big ideas require leadership skills to get them adopted by the larger organization.
    -   Leadership is essential to overcome an organization's natural **resistance to change**.
    -   The article presents an "equation" for **Innovation Impact**, suggesting it is a product of (Design Thinking) x (Domain Knowledge) x (Magnitude of the Problem), all divided by the (Cultural Resistance of an Organization to Change)^2.

### Summary: "Waterfall Methodology"

This text describes the Waterfall methodology, a traditional and linear approach to project management.

-   **Definition**: A project management model where operations are divided into sequential phases. Each new phase begins only after the previous one is complete.
-   **Analogy**: It is named "waterfall" because, like water, it flows in one direction. It is not possible to return to a previous phase; the only way to go back is to start the entire process over.
-   **History**: It is the oldest project management procedure, traditionally used in construction and manufacturing. It was formally introduced by Dr. Winston Royce in 1970 for large software development projects.

-   **Core Principles**:

    1.  **Sequential Structure**: Operations are strictly chronological. There is no revisiting a phase or changing course.
    2.  **Minimal Customer Involvement**: After an initial requirements phase, customer interaction is minimal until the final stages.
    3.  **Robust Documentation**: All requirements, timelines, costs, and processes must be documented in detail upfront.

-   **The 5 Stages**:

    1.  **Documenting Requirements**: The initial planning phase. All information from clients is gathered and documented extensively. This is the last point of client communication before work begins.
    2.  **Design**: The team reviews requirements and develops a design. This includes "logical design" (theoretical solutions) and "physical design" (concrete specifications like hardware or architecture). No building or coding occurs here.
    3.  **Implementation**: The "action" phase where the construction or coding happens. This can be the shortest stage because all planning is complete.
    4.  **Verification**: The testing phase. The quality assurance (QA) team checks the product for bugs and ensures all requirements are met. If major faults are found, the project may have to return to Stage 1.
    5.  **Maintenance**: This phase begins after the product is released to the client. The team fixes bugs or issues that appear during real-world use.

-   **When to Use Waterfall**:

    -   When the project has **clearly defined requirements** and an unambiguous end goal.
    -   When the project has **firmly set tasks and deadlines** (e.g., construction).
    -   When there is **ample time for upfront planning** and documentation.

-   **Pros**:

    -   In-depth upfront analysis leads to a clear implementation path.
    -   Provides accurate estimates for total cost and time.
    -   Easy to evaluate progress due to the highly structured approach.
    -   Creates repeatable, well-documented processes that are easy for new members to join.
    -   Limited customer involvement prevents "scope creep" and delays.

-   **Cons**:
    -   Assumes all requirements can be gathered at once, which is unrealistic for many projects.
    -   Making changes midway is very costly and difficult.
    -   Heavy upfront planning can make the total project time longer.
    -   Delays in one stage delay all subsequent stages.
    -   A working deliverable is not available until the final stages.

### Summary: "K-Scripts: The fastest and most flexible way to articulate a user experience" (Blade Kotelly)

This article introduces K-Scripts, a method for "sketching" user experiences using words instead of images.

-   **What is a K-Script?**

    -   A K-Script is a tool for articulating interactive experiences for software, hardware, and robotics. It functions as a form of rapid prototyping, similar to how a designer sketches a physical product.
    -   It uses a simple three-column table format, which can be as simple as a spreadsheet.

-   **Why use K-Scripts?**

    -   **Speed and Flexibility**: They are quick to create, inexpensive, and easily edited, which prevents designers from becoming too emotionally attached to one idea.
    -   **Avoids the "Uncanny Valley of Design"**: Presenting overly polished, high-fidelity mockups too early can cause stakeholders to focus on trivial details (like fonts or logo size) instead of the core concept. K-Scripts prevent this.
    -   **Engages Imagination**: Using words, like a book, allows the reader to imagine the vision, keeping them focused on the important aspects and encouraging them to provide meaningful feedback.
    -   **Alignment**: A set of K-Scripts can create a holistic view of a system that aligns different teams around a single vision.

-   **The 3 Essential Elements:**

    1.  **Who**: The actor performing the action (e.g., "Customer," "System," "Deli guy").
    2.  **Observable Action**: The action the actor performs or experiences that a viewer could observe (e.g., "Clicks on 'Buy tickets'," "Plays a success sound").
    3.  **Unobservable Action / Notes**: The "why" behind the action. This column includes user motivations, technical explanations, or questions and comments from collaborators.

-   **When to Use K-Scripts:**
    -   **Early Design Process**: Ideal for introducing and validating new ideas.
    -   **Throughout Design**: Can be refined and become more robust over time.
    -   **Ethnographic Research**: Can be used to map an _existing_ interaction (like ordering a sandwich) to find areas for improvement.
    -   **Error Conditions**: Can be used to articulate less common scenarios, like what happens when a user makes a mistake or doesn't respond.

### Summary: "Quantifying Innovation in the Modern Workplace" (Blade Kotelly)

This article argues that innovation is not an illusory trait but a **measurable and teachable skill**.

-   **Innovation vs. Invention:**

    -   **Invention** is the creation of something new (e.g., Joseph Swan's lightbulb).
    -   **Innovation** is the creation of _value_ from that invention (e.g., Thomas Edison's commercially successful lightbulb).

-   **Components of an Innovative Person:**
    Innovation is a combination of two distinct capabilities:

    1.  **Invention ("The Swan Axis")**: The ability to understand a problem in a new way and create a new solution for it.
    2.  **Leadership ("The Edison Axis")**: The ability to galvanize others to help build and implement the new solution.

    -   The **"Danger Zone of Innovation"** is when a person scores high in one of these skills but low in the other (e.g., a great inventor with no leadership skills or a strong leader with no invention skills).

-   **Creating an Innovative Culture:**
    Beyond individual skills, an innovative organization requires:

    1.  **High Self-Efficacy**: Confidence in one's ability to succeed, which is crucial for trying new approaches.
    2.  **Psychological Safety**: A shared belief that team members can ask questions, challenge results, and seek feedback without fear of negative consequences, especially when things aren't successful.

-   **How to Measure Innovation:**
    Innovation can be broken down, assessed, and improved.
    1.  **Individual Assessment**: A 20-minute assessment where people rate their attitudes and behaviors across six areas (e.g., innovation process, concept generation, managing uncertainty).
    2.  **Mapping**: Results are mapped on a "spider graph" to instantly show strengths and areas for growth.
    3.  **Organizational Metrics**: The assessment also rates the team's overall confidence and psychological safety.
    4.  **Dashboard**: An executive dashboard can be used to continuously monitor improvements and gain insights.
    -   This process allows organizations to transform employees with "concrete, measurable skills" rather than abstract concepts.

### Summary: "Principles behind the Agile Manifesto"

This text lists the 12 core principles of Agile development.

-   Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software.
-   **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
-   **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
-   Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.
-   Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and **trust them** to get the job done.
-   The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
-   **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.
-   Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
-   Continuous attention to **technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
-   **Simplicity**--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
-   The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
-   At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Summary: "A Framework for Innovation in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond" (Cromwell & Kotelly)

This article presents a framework to help businesses analyze innovations made during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine how to leverage them for future growth. It distinguishes between two fundamental types of innovation.

-   **Two Types of Innovation:**

    1.  **Traditional Innovation Process**: Starts by identifying a core problem or customer need, then generates and tests solutions to address it. This aligns with existing missions.
    2.  **Emergent Innovation Process**: Starts by anchoring on a _solution_ (like a new technology or existing resource) and then searches for a _problem_ it can solve. This explores entirely new business opportunities. Examples include 3M's Post-it Notes and Dyson applying vacuum tech to other products.

-   **The Framework:**
    The framework categorizes organizational responses based on two factors:

    1.  **How Customer Demand Changed**: Was the response addressing pre-COVID demand (Traditional Innovation) or new, COVID-emergent demand (Emergent Innovation)?
    2.  **How Long the Change Will Last**: Is the change temporary or sustained?

-   **Four Innovation Profiles:**

    1.  **Adapter** (Temporary Change / Pre-COVID Demand): Businesses met existing demand with temporary modifications, often using fewer resources. _Example_: Restaurants creating outdoor dining; Flour bakery centralizing baking. _Next Step_: Learn to reconfigure resources efficiently.
    2.  **Optimizer** (Sustained Change / Pre-COVID Demand): Businesses adapted to meet existing demand in ways that will persist post-pandemic. _Example_: Ikea investing more in its augmented reality app for online furniture visualization. _Next Step_: Increase efficiency of the sustained changes.
    3.  **Trendsetter** (Sustained Change / COVID-Emergent Demand): Businesses developed entirely new products/services for needs that emerged during the pandemic and will continue afterward. _Example_: Hospitals rapidly adopting and offering telemedicine. _Next Step_: Develop a best-in-class solution for this new offering.
    4.  **Trailblazer** (Temporary Change / COVID-Emergent Demand): Businesses used existing resources to solve _new, temporary_ problems created by the pandemic. _Example_: Dyson designing and manufacturing ventilators; distilleries making hand sanitizer. _Next Step_: Discover new problems where the learned emergent innovation skills can be reapplied.

-   **Leveraging Emergent Innovation (Trailblazers):**
    -   While often opportunistic, this innovation type can be used systematically.
    -   It requires comfort with uncertainty and ambiguity.
    -   The process should anchor on the _solution's constraints_ (e.g., available resources) rather than the problem's clarity.

### Summary: "SCRUM Development Process" (Schwaber)

This paper introduces the SCRUM methodology for systems development, contrasting it with traditional "defined" processes like Waterfall, Spiral, and Iterative.

-   **Core Idea**: Traditional methods assume development is a well-understood, predictable process that can be fully planned. SCRUM assumes development is unpredictable and complex, treating parts of it as an **"empirical"** or **"black box"** process that requires controls rather than detailed definition.
-   **Defined vs. Empirical Processes**:

    -   **Defined (Theoretical)**: Assumes processes are fully understood, inputs/outputs known, and results predictable (like Waterfall). Treating empirical processes as defined leads to unpredictability.
    -   **Empirical (Black Box)**: Assumes processes are not fully understood or are too complex/dynamic to define completely. Requires controls, measurement, and adaptation to manage unpredictability. SCRUM asserts system development is empirical.

-   **SCRUM Methodology Overview**:

    -   Enhances the **iterative/incremental approach**.
    -   Designed for managing, enhancing, or maintaining existing systems/prototypes initially.
    -   Emphasizes **flexibility**, responsiveness to changing requirements/environment, and risk control.
    -   Operates near the **"edge of chaos"** to maximize competitiveness while maintaining order.

-   **SCRUM Phases**:

    1.  **Pregame** (Defined Processes):
        -   _Planning_: Define backlog for a new release, estimate schedule/cost.
        -   _Architecture_: Design implementation of backlog items, modify system architecture.
    2.  **Game** (Empirical Process):
        -   _Development Sprints_: Iterative cycles (usually 1-4 weeks) to develop functionality. Consists of:
            -   _Develop_: Analyze, design, implement, test changes for backlog items.
            -   _Wrap_: Close changes, create executable version.
            -   _Review_: All teams present work, resolve issues, review risk, potentially add/change backlog items.
            -   _Adjust_: Consolidate information from review into work.
    3.  **Postgame** (Defined Processes):
        -   _Closure_: Prepare for release (final testing, documentation, etc.) when management determines conditions (time, competition, quality) are met.

-   **Key Characteristics & Controls**:

    -   **Backlog**: List of requirements (bugs, enhancements, etc.).
    -   **Sprints**: Short, fixed-duration iterations.
    -   **Reviews**: Frequent meetings after each Sprint involving the whole team, management, and potentially customers to inspect progress and adapt plans.
    -   **Flexibility**: Requirements and deliverables can change throughout the project based on feedback and environment.
    -   **Small Teams**: 3-6 people per team (developers, testers, documenters).
    -   **Collaboration & Knowledge Transfer**: Encouraged within and between teams.

-   **Advantages over Traditional Methods**:
    -   Higher probability of success in complex environments.
    -   Greater responsiveness to environmental changes throughout the project.
    -   Increased team flexibility and creativity.
    -   Delivers the "most appropriate release" based on current conditions.

### Summary: "The 2020 Scrum Guide" (Schwaber & Sutherland)

This text provides the official definition of Scrum, outlining its theory, values, components, and purpose.

-   **Definition**: Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through **adaptive solutions for complex problems**. It requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where a Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog, and the Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint, followed by inspection and adaptation for the next Sprint.
-   **Scrum Theory**: Founded on **empiricism** (knowledge comes from experience, decisions based on observation) and **lean thinking** (reduces waste and focuses on the essentials). It uses an **iterative, incremental approach** to control risk and optimize predictability.
-   **Empirical Pillars**:

    -   **Transparency**: Process and work must be visible. Decisions are based on the state of the three formal artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). Low transparency increases risk.
    -   **Inspection**: Scrum artifacts and progress toward goals must be inspected frequently to detect problems. Scrum events provide cadence for inspection.
    -   **Adaptation**: If the process or product deviates unacceptably, adjustments must be made promptly. Empowered, self-managing teams adapt upon learning something new.

-   **Scrum Values**: **Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage**. These values guide the team's work and reinforce the empirical pillars, building trust.

-   **The Scrum Team**: The fundamental unit (typically 10 or fewer people).

    -   **Characteristics**: Cohesive unit focused on one Product Goal at a time. No sub-teams or hierarchies. **Cross-functional** (contains all skills necessary to create value each Sprint) and **self-managing** (internally decides who does what, when, and how). Responsible for all product-related activities. Accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint.
    -   **Accountabilities**:
        -   **Developers**: People committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint. Accountable for creating the Sprint Backlog, ensuring quality (Definition of Done), adapting daily, and holding each other accountable.
        -   **Product Owner (PO)**: One person accountable for maximizing product value and managing the Product Backlog (developing Product Goal, creating/ordering items, ensuring transparency). Represents stakeholder needs; the entire organization must respect their decisions.
        -   **Scrum Master (SM)**: Accountable for establishing Scrum and the team's effectiveness. A true leader who serves the team (coaching, removing impediments, ensuring events are productive) and the organization (leading adoption, removing barriers).

-   **Scrum Events**: Formal opportunities for inspection and adaptation, creating regularity. All contained within the Sprint.

    -   **The Sprint**: The heartbeat; fixed-length event (≤ 1 month) where ideas turn into value. Contains all other events. A new Sprint starts immediately after the previous one ends. The Sprint Goal should not be endangered, quality doesn't decrease, and scope can be renegotiated. Can be cancelled only by the PO if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
    -   **Sprint Planning**: Initiates the Sprint (max 8 hours for 1-month Sprint). Addresses: _Why_ is the Sprint valuable (defines Sprint Goal)? _What_ can be done (selects Product Backlog items)? _How_ will it get done (Developers plan the work)? Output: Sprint Backlog.
    -   **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute event _for Developers_ to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog. Same time/place daily. Improves communication, identifies impediments, enables quick decisions.
    -   **Sprint Review**: Inspect the Sprint outcome and determine future adaptations (max 4 hours for 1-month Sprint). Team presents results to key stakeholders, discusses progress toward Product Goal, collaborates on next steps. A working session, not just a presentation.
    -   **Sprint Retrospective**: Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness (max 3 hours for 1-month Sprint). Team inspects the last Sprint (individuals, interactions, processes, tools, Definition of Done), identifies improvements, and may add actions to the next Sprint Backlog. Concludes the Sprint.

-   **Scrum Artifacts**: Represent work or value, designed to maximize transparency. Each has a commitment.

    -   **Product Backlog**: Emergent, ordered list of what's needed to improve the product. Single source of work. _Commitment: Product Goal_ (long-term objective for the team, describes future product state).
    -   **Sprint Backlog**: Sprint Goal (Why), selected Product Backlog items (What), and actionable plan (How). Plan by and for Developers. Updated throughout Sprint. _Commitment: Sprint Goal_ (single objective for the Sprint, provides focus and flexibility).
    -   **Increment**: A concrete stepping stone toward Product Goal. Must be usable and meet the Definition of Done. Additive to prior Increments. Can be delivered before Sprint end. _Commitment: Definition of Done (DoD)_ (formal description of Increment quality). If not met, item returns to Product Backlog. All teams on a product must mutually define and comply with the same DoD.

-   **End Note**: Scrum is free but immutable. Implementing only parts is not Scrum. Functions as a container for other practices.

### Summary: "Triumph of the Lean Production System" (Krafcik)

This article contrasts **"lean"** and **"buffered"** production systems in the auto industry, arguing that lean systems, pioneered by Toyota, achieve higher productivity and quality, often irrespective of location or technology level.

-   **Myth Busting**: Productivity and quality are _not_ predetermined by a plant's location (e.g., Japan vs. US vs. Europe). There's a wide range of performance within each region. Plant performance is more strongly linked to **corporate parentage, culture, and management philosophy**.
-   **Production System Evolution**:

    -   **Craftsmen (Pre-Ford)**: High worker skill, wide span of control, inefficient, large buffers/inventories.
    -   **Pure Fordism (Early Ford)**: Revolutionized production with moving assembly line, narrow worker span of control, work standardization (by managers), high efficiency, moderate/low inventories (continuous flow focus).
    -   **Recent Fordism ("Buffered")**: Evolved Western system with narrow worker span of control, high standardization (by managers), but large inventories, large repair areas, and many buffers (utility workers, line buffers) to guard against disruptions. Low risk, low potential return.
    -   **Toyota Production System (TPS / "Lean")**: Merged craftsmen philosophy (minds + hands) with Fordist standardization/assembly line. Moderate worker span of control, work standardization done by **teams**, emphasis on teamwork, very small inventories (JIT), minimal buffers/repair areas. High risk (disruptions stop production), high potential return.

-   **Lean vs. Buffered**:

    -   **Buffered**: Protects against problems with large inventories, repair areas, utility workers, etc. Safe but limits performance gains. Common in Western plants post-WWII.
    -   **Lean**: Minimizes inventory and buffers to reduce cost and quickly expose/solve quality problems. Relies on teamwork, worker skill/empowerment, and continuous improvement. Requires discipline but yields higher performance.

-   **Key Findings from Plant Study**:

    -   **Wide Performance Range**: Exists globally, with significant overlap between regions. Some US/European plants outperform some Japanese plants.
    -   **Productivity & Quality Correlation**: Strong positive correlation globally ("Quality is Free"). However, this correlation is weaker within Western-managed plants, suggesting less effectiveness in combining both.
    -   **Corporate Culture Matters**: Consistent performance levels within multinational corporations (regardless of plant location) suggest corporate culture/policy is as important as national location.
    -   **Lean Policy Predicts Performance**: A "Management Index" measuring leanness is a strong predictor of productivity and quality. Leaner plants tend to perform better.
    -   **Complexity Penalty**: Higher model mix complexity tends to decrease productivity. Lean plants seem better able to manage this penalty.
    -   **Technology is Not Key**: The level of robotics/flexible automation shows _little_ correlation with productivity or quality. High tech without a lean management policy doesn't guarantee high performance. Many high-performing Western plants have low automation levels.

-   **Implications**:
    -   Effective (lean) production management policies _can_ be implemented anywhere, regardless of location.
    -   Lean policies improve productivity and quality but require discipline and supporting resources (skilled workforce, good product design, responsive suppliers).
    -   Expensive automation is not a prerequisite for high performance and can be underutilized if organizational groundwork (lean principles) isn't laid first.

### Summary: "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning" (Rittel & Webber)

This paper argues that social policy problems are "wicked" problems, which are inherently different from the "tame" problems of science and engineering.

-   **Tame Problems**: Can be definitively described. They have clear missions and it's clear when a solution is found (e.g., solving a math equation).
-   **Wicked Problems**: Cannot be definitively described. They are ill-defined, and social problems are never truly "solved," only "re-solved over and over again". Examples include locating a freeway or confronting crime.

**Ten Properties of Wicked Problems:**

1.  **No definitive formulation**. The process of formulating the problem is the same as conceiving the solution. You can't understand the problem without having an idea of its solution.
2.  **No stopping rule**. There is no logical end to the problem. Planners stop for external reasons (e.g., out of time, money, or patience), not because the solution is perfect.
3.  **Solutions are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad**. There is no objective way to determine correctness. Assessments are "good enough" or "better or worse" based on different value-sets and interests.
4.  **No immediate and no ultimate test**. Any solution generates waves of consequences over an unbounded time, and these repercussions cannot be fully appraised.
5.  **Every solution is a "one-shot operation"**. There is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error without significant consequences. An implemented solution (like a freeway) is effectively irreversible and leaves "traces".
6.  **No enumerable set of potential solutions**. There is no exhaustive list of all possible solutions or permissible moves.
7.  **Every wicked problem is essentially unique**. Despite similarities to past problems, there may always be a unique, overriding property. Transferring a solution from one context to another is harmful.
8.  **Every wicked problem can be a symptom of another problem**. The level at which a problem is formulated (e.g., "crime in the streets" as a symptom of poverty) determines its resolution.
9.  **The choice of explanation determines the resolution**. A discrepancy can be explained in numerous ways, and there is no "correct" one. The analyst's "world view" is the strongest factor in resolving the problem.
10. **The planner has no right to be wrong**. Unlike a scientist, a planner is liable for the consequences of their actions, which have real effects on people's lives.

**Social Context:**

-   Society is not homogeneous but increasingly pluralistic and heterogeneous.
-   In a pluralistic society, there is no "undisputable public good" and no objective definition of equity.
-   What is a "problem-solution" for one group is "problem-generation" for another.
-   Planning is a component of politics, and the expert is a player in a political game.

### Summary: "Design of Everyday Things" (Ch. 6 Design Thinking)

This chapter defines design thinking as a process focused on first finding the _right problem_ and then finding the _right solution_.

-   **Solving the Correct Problem**:

    -   The problem you are given is invariably a _symptom_, not the real, fundamental, root problem.
    -   Engineers and businesspeople are trained to _solve_ problems; designers are trained to _discover_ the real problems.
    -   A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all.

-   **The Double-Diamond Model of Design**:

    -   This model shows how designers first diverge to explore options, then converge on a decision. This is done twice.
    -   **Phase 1: Finding the Right Problem**
        -   **Divergence (Discover):** Expand thinking to explore all underlying issues.
        -   **Convergence (Define):** Settle on the real, underlying problem to be solved.
    -   **Phase 2: Finding the Right Solution**
        -   **Divergence (Develop):** Explore a wide variety of potential solutions.
        -   **Convergence (Deliver):** Converge on a single proposed solution.

-   **The Human-Centered Design (HCD) Process**:
    -   HCD is the iterative method used _within_ the double-diamond model.
    -   It consists of a repeating cycle of four activities: **Observation, Idea Generation, Prototyping, and Testing**.

**The Four HCD Activities:**

1.  **Observation (Design Research)**:
    -   Understand the nature of the problem by observing people in their natural environment.
    -   This is often done using **applied ethnography**.
    -   **Design Research** (qualitative, deep insights from a few people) seeks to understand _real needs_.
    -   **Market Research** (quantitative, broad data from many people) seeks to understand _what people will buy_. Both are necessary.
2.  **Idea Generation (Ideation)**:
    -   The creative phase.
    -   **Key Rules**:
        -   Generate _numerous_ ideas.
        -   Be creative _without regard for constraints_; do not criticize or dismiss ideas prematurely.
        -   **Question everything**, especially "stupid questions" about things everyone assumes are obvious.
3.  **Prototyping**:
    -   The only way to know if an idea is reasonable is to test it.
    -   Mock-ups can be simple sketches, cardboard models, or even skits.
    -   The **"Wizard of Oz"** technique involves faking a system's functionality (e.g., a human types responses for a supposed AI) to test requirements early.
4.  **Testing**:
    -   Gather a small group (e.g., **five people**) from the target population.
    -   Have them use the prototype in a realistic context.
    -   Testing five people is usually enough to find the major problems. It is better to test and iterate multiple times (e.g., test 5, fix, test 5 more) than to test a large group once.

-   **Iteration**:
    -   The HCD process is repeated to enable continual refinement.
    -   The goal is to **"Fail frequently, fail fast"**.
    -   "Failures" are valuable **learning experiences**.
    -   Getting requirements right is the hardest part of design and requires iteration. Asking people what they need is "invariably wrong"; observing them is better.
